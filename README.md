# 100 Days of Cybersecurity Code Challenge 🛡️👨‍💻

## Description

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code Challenge, where I embark on a journey to deepen my knowledge and skills in cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and pentesting. This repository is the central hub for all my daily coding activities, projects, and notes as I utilize Python, Bash, and JavaScript to explore various cybersecurity methodologies and tools.

## Key Features

- **Daily Updates** 📅: Each day, I will commit code, scripts, or detailed notes that reflect my learning and experimentation with different cybersecurity concepts and practices.
- **Language-Specific Folders** 📁: Organized repositories for Python, Bash, and JavaScript, each containing scripts and applications tailored to cybersecurity tasks.
- **Project-Based Learning** 🏗️: Focus on real-world applications, including building custom tools for network scanning, vulnerability assessments, and penetration tests.
- **Tool Integration** 🧰: Utilization of various open-source tools and frameworks within my scripts to enhance learning and practical application, such as Nmap for network scanning, Burp Suite for web application security, and various command-line utilities for Linux.
- **Cybersecurity Concepts** 📘: Detailed exploration of topics such as network security, application security, cryptography, intrusion detection, and ethical hacking techniques.
- **Environment Setup** ⚙️: Instructions and scripts to set up and configure Linux environments for safe and effective hacking practices.

## Objective

Through this 100-day challenge, I aim to build a robust portfolio demonstrating my skills in cybersecurity, while also contributing to the community by sharing open-source tools and educational content. Join me in this journey to transform curiosity into expertise by following along or contributing to the development.
